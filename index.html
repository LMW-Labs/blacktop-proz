                    <p class="service-hook">A cracked, stained driveway doesn't just look bad—it's costing you money. Every day that water seeps into those cracks, the damage spreads deeper. Every freeze-thaw cycle makes it worse. And when you finally sell? Buyers notice.</p>
                    <p>At BlackTop Proz, we build driveways that last 25+ years in Mississippi's brutal climate. Our process starts with proper excavation and a compacted base—the step most contractors skip to save time. We use 4,000 PSI concrete rated for heavy vehicles, reinforced with fiber mesh or rebar depending on your needs.</p>

One trip, one fall, one broken hip, and you're facing medical bills and legal fees that dwarf the cost of fixing it right. Mississippi courts don't take kindly to negligent property owners.</p>
                    <p>Our walkways are built on properly prepared bases with control joints placed strategically to prevent random cracking. We slope them correctly for drainage so you won't have puddles or ice patches. And we can match your existing concrete or create something completely new.</p>

                    <p class="service-hook">You bought that grill three years ago. It's been used maybe five times because your "backyard" is just mud and dead grass. Your kids play inside. Your friends suggest going to their place instead. That outdoor living space you imagined? It doesn't exist yet.</p>
                    <p>A properly built concrete patio changes everything. Suddenly you have a place for the table, the grill, the fire pit. The kids have somewhere to ride bikes. You can actually host a cookout without everyone standing in mud. And unlike wood decks, concrete doesn't rot, warp, or need yearly maintenance.</p>

                    <h2>The Smart Choice When Concrete Doesn't Make Sense</h2>
                    <p class="service-hook">Got a 200-foot driveway on a rural property? Concrete would cost you $15,000+. A properly installed gravel driveway? Under $3,000—and it handles heavy trucks better than cheap concrete ever would. Sometimes the simpler solution is the smarter one.</p>
                    <p>But here's the thing most people don't know: a gravel driveway done wrong is a muddy, rutted mess within a year. Done right—with proper grading, drainage, geotextile fabric, and the right stone layers—it lasts for decades with minimal maintenance. We do it right.</p>

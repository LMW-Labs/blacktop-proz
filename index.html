                    <p>With over 15 years paving driveways and parking lots across Rankin County, we know what Mississippi heat and rain do to cheap asphalt work. Our team uses commercial-grade hot mix, proper compaction equipment, and the base preparation that separates pavement lasting 5 years from pavement lasting 25.</p>

                    <p class="service-hook">A cracked, faded driveway doesn't just look bad—it's costing you money. Every day that water seeps into those cracks, the base erodes further. Mississippi's 100-degree summers make it worse, cooking unprotected asphalt until it crumbles. And when you sell? Buyers notice immediately.</p>
                    <p>At BlackTop Proz, we install asphalt driveways that last 20+ years with proper maintenance. Our process starts with full excavation and a properly compacted aggregate base—the step weekend warriors and cheap contractors skip. We use commercial-grade hot-mix asphalt, laid at proper thickness and compacted with professional equipment.</p>

                    <p class="service-hook">Here's the secret most homeowners don't know: unsealed asphalt fails in 7-10 years. Properly sealcoated asphalt lasts 20-25 years. That's not marketing—that's chemistry. UV rays oxidize asphalt binder, turning it gray and brittle. Sealcoat blocks the sun, repels water, and keeps your pavement flexible.</p>
                    <p>Professional sealcoating should be done every 2-3 years. It's a fraction of the cost of replacement and makes your driveway look brand new overnight. We use commercial-grade coal tar or asphalt emulsion sealers—not the watered-down stuff from the hardware store.</p>
                    <h3>Sealcoating Benefits:</h3>

                    <p class="service-hook">Some contractors will tell you the whole driveway needs to go. That's often a lie—they make more money on full replacements. The truth? Many asphalt problems can be fixed for a fraction of the cost if you catch them early enough.</p>
                    <p>We'll give you an honest assessment. Crack filling at $200 beats a $6,000 replacement. But if your base has failed and patches won't hold, we'll tell you that too. No games, no upselling—just straight answers about what your pavement actually needs.</p>
